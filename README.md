This Repository is a rehabilitation of the
[Kensai Music DB](https://github.com/jmauran91/GroupProject_tOtK)
project. The problem with the original publication of this project is
that the React components worked locally, but did not work when hosted
on the Heroku platform. The difference between this Repo and the previous
Repo mentioned above is that this one is built on the React_on_Rails gem
and now, thankfully, has all of its React components functioning normally.
Testing suites have not been added as of yet and there may still remain
some glitchy behavior, but on the whole this Repo represents the intended
functionality of the original project.
